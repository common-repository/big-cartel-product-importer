Import your products from Big Cartel to a Product custom post type in WordPress.

== Description ==

After struggling to find a solution to the problem of importing BigCartel products into WordPress, I settled on "make one yourself".  So, that's what I set out to do.  With this plugin, you can finally link your WordPress website and BigCartel stores by importing your products as posts in a Product custom post type.  The importer pulls in the product ID, product price, product description, product URL, product image for each product.  It will also pull in product categories and assign each product to the proper category.

[Pluginize](https://pluginize.com/?utm_source=big-cartel&utm_medium=text&utm_campaign=wporg) was launched in 2016 by [WebDevStudios](https://webdevstudios.com/) to promote, support, and house all of their [WordPress products](https://pluginize.com/shop/?utm_source=big-cartel&utm_medium=text&utm_campaign=wporg). Pluginize is not only creating new products for WordPress all the time, but also provides [ongoing support and development for WordPress community favorites like CPTUI](https://wordpress.org/plugins/custom-post-type-ui/), [CMB2](https://wordpress.org/plugins/cmb2/), and more
